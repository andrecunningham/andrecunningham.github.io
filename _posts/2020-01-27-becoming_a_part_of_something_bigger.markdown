Hi! My name is Andre Cunningham and as the title suggests i am an islander from the beautiful island of jamaica,
i am 31 years old, coding has always been something that i loved and wanted to do ever since i got my first computer back in 99. i just thin there is so much you can do and accomplish with it in every aspect of life, the feeling you get knowing you are apart of something that is bigger than yourself and can make a positive influence in the worl is beyond great and thats what i strive for.
