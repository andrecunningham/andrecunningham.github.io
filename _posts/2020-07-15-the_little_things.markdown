I remember what living used to be before all this started, i went throught life like a leafe in the river just floating allong riding the waves and going wherever it chose to take me. funny hoe everything in out lives has changed and now we are all forced to not only take notice of everything around us but ourselves aswell, i fell life is about to take a drastic turn weather its for better or worse has yet to be seen.
