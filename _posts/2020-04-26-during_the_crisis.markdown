Im not very good at writing, i dont think i ever was actually. throught my life i have always pride myself in accomplishing my dream, set a goal and fight through hell to get it , no matter what you try you fight and never give up untill you have nothing left. that has always been my life, but this is diferent for some reason, it feels diferent and i dont know why. ive always told myself that this is what i wanted this is what i strive for and now im not too sure, i cant stay motivated, ive lost my passion my drive and zeel, with all thats going on in the world right now im unsure of allot of this but this should not be one of the after all this is what i wanted my whole life, right?
